# Self-Improving-Meta-Learning-for-Autonomous-AI-Architectures
ðŸ”¹ Objective: Design an RL-based Meta-Learning framework that modifies its neural architecture based on task complexity.

## Proposed Methodology:
Dataset: Use Omniglot, Mini-ImageNet, or CIFAR-100 for few-shot learning evaluation.
## Meta-Learning Framework:
Use MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning) + Reinforcement Learning (PPO/TD3).
Develop an RL-based controller to decide when and how to prune, expand, or modify network layers.
Optimization: Train models with a reward function based on:
Computational efficiency (flops, latency).
Task accuracy improvement.
Benchmarking: Compare with static CNNs, ViTs, and NAS (Neural Architecture Search) approaches.
Applications: Deploy in autonomous robots, edge AI, and adaptive AI assistants.
